Exponential Search

This Python script demonstrates the implementation of the Exponential Search algorithm for finding the index of a target element in a sorted array. The algorithm works by doubling the index to search until a potential range is identified and then conducting a binary search within this range.

Example

Enter a sorted array (comma-separated): 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16
Enter the target element to search for: 12
Output:Element 12 found at index 6
